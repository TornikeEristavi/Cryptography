1. TLS Handshake Explanation
The TLS handshake is the process by which a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server establish a secure communication channel. When a client connects to a server using HTTPS, the handshake begins with both sides agreeing on a TLS version and cryptographic algorithms (cipher suites) to use. The server then sends its digital certificate, issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), to prove its identity. The client verifies this certificate to ensure it is valid and matches the server’s domain. After verification, both sides use a key exchange algorithm (such as Diffie–Hellman or ECDHE) to securely generate session keys, which are unique encryption keys used to protect the session. Once the handshake completes, all subsequent data is encrypted and authenticated using these keys.

2. MITM Protection Mechanisms
TLS protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through a combination of authentication, encryption, and integrity verification. Authentication is achieved through server certificates, ensuring the client connects to the legitimate server rather than an attacker. Encryption, provided by symmetric keys generated during the handshake, prevents attackers from reading intercepted data. Integrity is maintained using Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or authenticated encryption (e.g., AES-GCM), which detect any tampering of transmitted data. Furthermore, modern TLS implementations use Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), ensuring that even if a server’s private key is later compromised, past communications remain secure.

3. TLS Application in Websites
TLS is the core security protocol behind HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which protects data exchanged between web browsers and websites. When users visit a website with HTTPS, TLS ensures that login credentials, payment details, and personal information are transmitted securely. The browser displays a padlock icon and uses the “https://” prefix to indicate that the connection is encrypted and verified. This not only prevents eavesdropping and data manipulation but also establishes user trust by confirming the website’s authenticity.
